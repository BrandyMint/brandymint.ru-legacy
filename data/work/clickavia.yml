  description: |
    Clickavia provides 
    __comfortable service to find and buy airline tickets__.
    These great folks asked to analyze existing codebase and refactor some modules to rise code quality level at first.
    Later they offered us to develop mobile applications so their customers could search and buy tickets everywhere they go.
    That work included separate
    __server-side API__
    and iPhone/iPad applications (now in alpha).
  features:
    1: Code review
    2: Refactoring (ruby)
    3: Backend separation
    4: Server-side API
    5: iOS development
  technologies:
    1: Ruby
    2: Objective-C
  methodologies:

        In 2013 we were asked by Clickavia CTO Pavel Bubentsov to review project architecture and code.
        The company was running quite well while there were some technical problems about its futher development and extension.
        We checked metrics and took a look at architecture: the codebase needed some optimization.
        <br><br>
        We reconsidered the system with Domainâ€“driven design approach and GRASP/SOLID principles.
        Then made refactoring, separated the project into two applications so the code became much cleaner and easy to understand.
        This essentially accelerated and simplified overall project development.
        Codeclimate GPA was improved from 1.8 to 3.0.

        Travel industry is growing really fast and many companies already offer ordering tickets via smartphone or tablet.
        So it was quite logical decision for Clickavia to create iPhone and iPad apps. As we use lean approach we created
        clickable lo-fi prototypes that helped us to define project objectives on the first stage.

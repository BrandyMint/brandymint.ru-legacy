  More and more people prefer to exchange between each other instead of buying all new.
  __SwapUrban__
  focuses on this fact and offers a service to swap books.
  It is based on
  __Amazon book search__
  so you can find any book there, add it to your wishlist and get notified if someone offers it (or get rid of your unused books).
  __Swap process__
  has its own iterface with price balance between offers and wants.
  __Realtime chat__  helps to communicate seamless and define exchange details.
  
  There's a strong accent on  __geolocation–based communities and filtering__ so you don't need to waste your time searching offers nearby.
  
  This startup founders came to us with ideas in their bright minds, and we built the product from the very start,
  including paper prototypes and intercative one.
  
  SwapUrban is __award–winning participant of Venture Fair 2013 (Kazan, Russia)__.

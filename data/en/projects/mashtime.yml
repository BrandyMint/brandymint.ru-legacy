  We built Mashtime to track our working hours so we can analyze how we worked on projects and plan further work
  or estimate upcoming projects better. It's made for teams, projects and freelancers.
  Of course, it is responsive so everyone can record his hours on the go.
  Mashtime remembers the way you use it — more tracking time or more analyzing reports — and helps you
  to find dashboard pages that are important for you.
